ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Misha Khan (she/her) and I am a current graduate at the University of California, Irvine pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics with an expected graduated date of August 2021. 
Prior to this, I attended University of California, Riverside where I majored in Statistics and graduated in June 2020. 

ðŸŒ± During my undergraduate at UC Riverside, I fell in love with statistics and I knew I wanted to pursue a career in this field. Seeing how powerful understanding metrics intrigued me to gain a deeper understanding behind analytics. As a current graduate student studying business analytics at UC Irvine, I have had the opportunity to be exposed to several types of projects that allow me to develop my analytical skills. From creating visualizations on Tableau, performing machine learning algorithms in Python, and running analysis on R, I am amazed at how data can be manipulated into something meaningful. Analytics has the ability to pinpoint a specific error in an overall issue and guide companies to become more efficient in their system.

ðŸ‘€ I am open to work in August 2021 and interested in data analyst, business analyst, marketing analyst positons!
